End-effector distance
=====================

End-effector distance computes the Euclidean distance between the base and tip frames:

.. math::

    \Phi_\text{Dist}(\boldsymbol{x}) = ||\boldsymbol{P}_A^B||.

The resulting task map has the same function as the ``end-effector position`` map. The output, however, is a scalar distance.
